						<h1>FEDSA - Code of Conduct</h1>
						<p>
							FEDSA meetups are community events for networking in the Front End
							Developer South Africa community. We value the participation of
							each member of the community and want all attendees and sponsors
							to have an enjoyable and fulfilling experience. Accordingly, all
							attendees and sponsors are expected to show respect and courtesy
							to other attendees. To make clear what is expected, all attendees
							and sponsors are required to conform to this Code of Conduct.
							Organisers will enforce this code throughout events.
						</p>
						<h2>TL;DR</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>Be respectful of others, including non-members</li>
							<li>Do not harass others</li>
							<li>
								Do not share personal information of others to people outside
								the community
							</li>
							<li>All content must be &quot;safe for work&quot;</li>
						</ul>
						<p>This is a safe space, let&#39;s keep it that way.</p>
						<h2>Code of Conduct</h2>
						<p>
							&quot;FEDSA&quot; in this document refers to the the Front End
							Developer South Africa organisation at
							<a href="https://fedsa.org/">https://fedsa.org/</a>. &quot;The
							organisers&quot; refers to the administrators on this
							organization, which can be accessed
							<a
								href="https://www.meetup.com/fedsa-community/members/?op=leaders"
								>here</a
							>.
						</p>
						<p>
							FEDSA is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for
							everyone. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any
							form.
						</p>
						<p>
							This code of conduct applies to all FEDSA spaces, including all
							events (online and in-person), direct messages, and any
							communication between members. Anyone who violates this code of
							conduct may be sanctioned or expelled from these spaces at the
							discretion of the organisers.
						</p>
						<h3>Harassment includes:</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>
								Offensive comments related to gender, gender identity and
								expression, sexual orientation, disability, mental illness,
								neuro(a)typicality, physical appearance, body size, race, or
								religion
							</li>
							<li>
								Unwelcome comments regarding a person’s lifestyle choices and
								practices, including those related to food, health, parenting,
								drugs, and employment.
							</li>
							<li>
								Deliberate misgendering or use of &quot;dead&quot; or rejected
								names
							</li>
							<li>
								Gratuitous or off-topic sexual images or behaviour in spaces
								where they’re not appropriate
							</li>
							<li>
								Physical contact and simulated physical contact (eg, textual
								descriptions like &quot;hug&quot; or &quot;backrub&quot;)
								without consent or after a request to stop.
							</li>
							<li>Threats of violence</li>
							<li>
								Incitement of violence towards any individual, including
								encouraging a person to commit suicide or to engage in self-harm
							</li>
							<li>Deliberate intimidation</li>
							<li>Stalking or following</li>
							<li>
								Harassing photography or recording, including logging online
								activity for harassment purposes
							</li>
							<li>Sustained disruption of discussion</li>
							<li>Unwelcome sexual attention</li>
							<li>
								Pattern of inappropriate social contact, such as
								requesting/assuming inappropriate levels of intimacy with others
							</li>
							<li>
								Continued one-on-one communication after requests to cease
							</li>
							<li>
								Deliberate &quot;outing&quot; of any aspect of a person’s
								identity without their consent except as necessary to protect
								vulnerable people from intentional abuse
							</li>
							<li>Publication of non-harassing private communication</li>
						</ul>
						<h2>Reporting</h2>
						<p>
							If you are being harassed by a member of FEDSA, notice that
							someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns there
							are a few methods for reporting. Organisers will respond as soon
							as they are able. If the person who is harassing you is on the
							organising team, they will recuse themselves from handling your
							incident.
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								DM an
								<a
									href="https://www.meetup.com/fedsa-community/members/?op=leaders"
									>organiser</a
								>
							</li>
							<li>
								During an online event send a private message to an organiser
							</li>
							<li>During an in-person event approach one of the organisers</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							This code of conduct applies to FEDSA spaces, but if you are being
							harassed by a member of FEDSA outside of our spaces, we still want
							to know about it. We will take all good-faith reports of
							harassment by FEDSA members, especially the administrators,
							seriously. This includes harassment outside our spaces and
							harassment that took place at any point in time. The abuse team
							reserves the right to exclude people from FEDSA based on their
							past behavior, including behavior outside FEDSA spaces and
							behavior towards people who are not members of the FEDSA
							community.
						</p>
						<p>
							We will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of
							protecting victims of abuse. At our discretion, we may publicly
							name a person about whom we’ve received harassment complaints, or
							privately warn third parties about them, if we believe that doing
							so will increase the safety of FEDSA members or the general
							public. We will not name harassment victims without their
							affirmative consent.
						</p>
						<h2>Acceptable Content</h2>
						<p>
							It is expected that the content made available by members of the
							community should at all times adhere to the acceptable content
							policy. This policy is intended to protect the community&#39;s
							image, as well as the image of its members, through restrictions
							on certain classes of content which may be deemed to be unsuitable
							in a work or social context.
						</p>
						<p>
							Links to content are deemed as acceptable as the content within.
						</p>
						<p>Classes of content which we deem to be unsuitable include:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								Pornographic or sexually suggestive material, either in graphic
								or text form.
							</li>
							<li>
								Depictions of physical or emotional abuse, either in graphic or
								text form.
							</li>
							<li>
								Persecution of any individual as a result of their race, gender,
								religion or other physical traits.
							</li>
							<li>
								Material intended to, without basis, harm the reputation of any
								individual whether a member or not.
							</li>
							<li>Unsolicited advertising.</li>
							<li>
								Links, or links to pages, for the purpose of monetization of
								user views and which provide no value to the FEDSA community.
							</li>
							<li>Content infringing on copyright laws.</li>
						</ul>
						<h2>Consequences</h2>
						<p>
							Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to
							comply immediately.
						</p>
						<p>
							If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the organisers may
							take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including
							expulsion from all FEDSA spaces and identification of the
							participant as a harasser to other FEDSA members and/or the
							general public.
						</p>
						<p>
							Intentionally evading exclusions, bans, suspensions, restrictions,
							or otherwise interfering with the admin team&#39;s decisions and
							actions are not permitted.
