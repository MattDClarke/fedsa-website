  "text": "These communities have been active for a couple of years at the time and have seen the creation and death of several HTML, CSS, JavaScript and design meetups or other community projects over this time. FEDSA was established as an umbrella organisation to support meetups, conferences and/or open-source maintainers in the South African front-end development space.\n\nWe are made up of diverse group of volunteers, providing their time and expertise, as well as a variety of sponsors that help cover operational costs. Our goal is to support both front-end developers (and other professionals working alongside front-end developers) to create a better web experience for all South Africans.\n\nIf you are interested, we would love to have you join our team of part-time volunteers. All skill levels welcome!."
